Jimmy was a cat. He had three friends. Babik was a dog. He was the funniest of them. Patty was a parrot. He was the most talkative. Simon was a spider. He was the most hardworking. Jimmy saw the calendar. It was Babik’s birthday. Friends chose presents. Patty made a wooden stick. Simon made a scarf. Jimmy got balloons in a box. Babik loved the balloons. All the friends drank tea and juices. They ate chocolates and cakes. It was the best party.

I was in garden. A humming bird burst from nearby blooms. It turned into a fish. A butterfly sang a tune. A seahorse scuttled. A raindrop puddled. An owl howled at the moon. An octopus waved his hand. The clouds moved in. I saw a tiny seed burst forth into a tree. A tabby was sitting on its branch. It laughed at me.
